# Sign-up Form

![Form](https://i.imgur.com/6h8Bia7.png)

A static website whose purpose is to emulate an sign-up form. This project served as practice for building responsive websites with CSS Flexbox.

The original design, on which this version was based, can be found in the 'sign-up-form.png' file under the 'img' directory.

Note: the buttons and outlines are purely illustrative. There's no actual form validation going on.
